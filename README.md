# freaking-finished-loops-excersice-in-C

This is the second project, not neccesarily a project but a exercise that I've completed without any help of internet.

It is so difficult to conceptualize loops for me (I'm still a beginner:)) yet I need to improve these for me to go on more complex stuff.

This is just a challenge, I hope I can master all of this (the same as Maths and Physics for Robotics)...
